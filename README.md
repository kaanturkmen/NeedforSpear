# Need for Spear by /dev/null

This game is developed by /dev/null team (see contributors), and it is our final project for the Software Engineering
course (COMP302). The main objective on this project is to implement design patterns, obey the MVVM design and get used
to Agile Development.

While we were developing this game, we did not only want to practise what we have learned in the course, but also create
a game that we will enjoy while playing.

Need for Spear game is developed for educational purposes. We are publishing this project to contribute to the open
source community.

# Additional Info

As dev/null, we were using the private Git server as a version control system and most of our commits are located on
that server.

Also, I was the team lead on this project. I have followed Agile Development phases: Requirements, Design and
Development for each sprint to perform task divisions between team members.

Special thanks to all my team members for their commitment on this project.
