# Additional Info

As a dev/null, we were using the private Git server as a version control system and most of our commits located on that server.

Also, I was the team lead on this project. I have followed Agile Development phases: Requirements, Design and Development for each
sprint to perform task divisions between team members.

Special thanks to all my team members for their commitment on this project.
